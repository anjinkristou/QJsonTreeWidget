QJsonTreeWidget uses QJSon library by Fabio Castelli (http://qjson.sourceforge.net), it must be checkouted at the same
level of the qjsontreewidget folder :

qjson/
qjsontreewidget/
 src/
  ...

Then, just open the qjsontreewidget.pro in QtCreator and compile. A test application can be found in <outdir>/test.

to deploy, you have to take care yourself of distributing the qjson DLL/.so with your application.
