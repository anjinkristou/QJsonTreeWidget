QJsonTreeWidget uses QJSon library by Fabio Castelli (http://qjson.sourceforge.net), it must be checkouted in the libs folder
together with the src of qjsontreewidget.

libs/qjson/
libs/qjsontreewidget/

Then, just open the testqjstw.pro in QtCreator and compile. A test application can be found in <outdir>/test.

to deploy, you have to take care yourself of distributing the qjson DLL/.so with your application.
